Generative labyrinth of rooms, meditative game-watching, and responsive screen-resize

A generative algorithm and its on-screen viewing is a container of rules 
inside a container of rules 
inside a container of rules. 
Rules, rules, rules. 
As baroque or bare as you want. 
In this case, kind of byzantine.
	
Unicurse is an arrangement of 12 rooms, halfway between architectural plan and colorful circuit board. 
Placed together the rooms form a unicursal labyrinth connected in sequence by a thread.

The 12 rooms are built from a kit of parts - surfaces, structure, podia, cupola - arranged randomly. 
There are a lot of constraints shaping what goes with what. 
Random() is such a powerful driver of generative art, here I am trapping it with architectural regulation.
Other things join the sequential ball of thread transiting through the labyrinth; 
a ghost with its own pathway (its own rules), 
skittish bugs that scatter and occasionally explode, 
crypts. 

As the rooms resize to suit the window proportions (the screen, that other container of rules) 
they unroll to reveal an underground, then roll up again with contraction. 
Screen resize is a tactile way of interacting with a digital artwork whose systems recalculate and rearrange to viewing device. 
I like how clunky and imprecise and laggy this movement is, 
how extremes of proportion can nearly break the work, 
I like how the viewer is actively prodding and poking the algorithm via a physical viewing apparatus (mouse, touchpad, actual fingers). 
The medium has a friction, it almost has a sound.

Central to the Unicurse is the graphic attraction of the architectural plan, 
its symbols and language (more rules) layering up, 
representing a spatial yet unrealised world through a completely hypothetical viewpoint, 
a thought experiment slicing horizontally through mass and air.
